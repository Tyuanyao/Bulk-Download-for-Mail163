# Bulk-Download-for-Mail163
This repository include  the code for automatically logging in 163 mail box and downloading the mail attachments in bulk.  I write this code for the convience of quickly receiving the students' homework from 163 mail box since I start to be a TA at the university last year 2018. By running this code, you can download the mail attachements in bulk by setting the time period you like (e.g. from last month to the  deadline date) and you don't have to open every mail to download the mail attachment one by one anymore, which is really exhuasted if you have over 100 students in the class like me. If your university have the system to receive homeworks from every student online, I admire you.
